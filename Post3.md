# Site Philosophy: Research vs. First Principles

## What kind of site do I want this to be?
I knew I wanted to start a blog where I solve problems. But now it has become obvious that this simple purpose is not good enough. I need to define other things like how I will find the solutions to the problems that I am trying to solve.

## A Spectrum from research to first principles
At one extreme, this could be a pure research blog. In such a case, I would ask questions and find information about those questions. There would be no interpretation on my part, and this blog would serve only to transfer interesting/important/useful information. The advantage of this method is that I have more information at my fingertips (internet) than 99% of people in history, so it is reasonable to think that this method could be quite effective. The downside is that I would naturally take in any mistakes that are found in the research since I would not be doing any reasoning myself. 

At the other end of the spectrum, I could take a first-principles approach. I could do no research and use pure reasoning to deduce my answers. This would avoid the problem of inheriting mistakes from other research. However, it comes with the danger that I am limited to my own understanding.

It seems like the best approach is somewhere in the middle. But how do I combine these two aspects?

## Finding our spot on the spectrum (Combining approacheds)
I think the best approach would go something like this. After identifying the problem, I would do first-principles reasoning about the problem. After this reasoning, I will try to objectively criticize my understanding of the problem. Next, I will analyze this criticism to determine whether I need to do research, and in what areas. I would set a research plan to find some concise information, then return to first-principles reasoning upon finding that information. This is a simple process that I can perform iteratively until a reasonable conclusion is reached.

This is a fairly simple solution, and I was not expecting things to be so simple but now it seems obvious. We can now outline the general iterative process as:

1. Reason about the problem from first principles
2. Identify any gaps in my understanding
3. Identify a research plan based on gaps in understanding
4. Execute the research plan if additional research is necessary. If no research is necessary, then a conclusion has been reached.

This is a solid process. I think I should also add something where I evaluate the processes by which I do things so I can update and improve as necessary.

## Next Steps
Now I need to outline the rest of the process. What comes before this? What comes after this? What are the specific steps? How do I ensure that I am making progress in my research? I think I need a blog post on how to do the entire process.
