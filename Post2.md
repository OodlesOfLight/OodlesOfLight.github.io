# Some Interesting Problems

## Questions about what?
The rules for this site have been set, so what are some interesting questions that I can start digging into? The overarching goal of this blog can be described as problem-solving. Society is constantly developing new complexities, and it seems like new problems spring up faster than the current ones can be solved. 

Reasonable solutions can be found to many problems, but it requires rigorous thought, thorough research, and serious dedication to finding an answer. Sounds like too much time, right? Right is the answer for most people. We want to live interesting, long lives filled with the people we love. Thinking about large-scale societal issues that take decades to solve doesn't have much, if anything, to do with our day-to-day happiness.

## So why bother trying to solve them? 

First off is personal reasons. My favorite activities in life are reading about, thinking about, and discussing these sorts of large-scale problems. I find it incredibly fun and fulfilling. 

Secondly, society will find solutions no matter what. Sometimes benevolent actors are hard at work to optimize solutions for the average/normal person. This is the best scenario. Sometimes the worst scenario happens, where malicious actors engineer a solution that will benefit a few at the cost of the average/normal person. Or the neutral scenario takes place, where no one tries to solve the problem, and the natural course of things takes place to offer a solution. 

The solution to a good society, so far as I can tell, is maximizing the percentage of people who are "benevolent actors" while maximizing communication and open-mindedness within the community. Benevolent actors find good solutions, foil the efforts of malicious actors, and shift neutral scenarios towards better solutions. We all can be benevolent actors. Most of us, including myself, tend towards laziness and want to be neutral actors. This blog is one way that I am trying to stop being a neutral actor. I want to be a benevolent actor.

We want to be benevolent actors. So we want to solve  problems

## How do we solve them?
The best way I know to solve problems is the scientific method, which I use for problem-solving in every aspect of my life. Loosely, it goes something like this:
1. Find the question
2. Predict an answer to the question
3. Find a repeatable test that proves your answer true or false
5. Perform test & collect results
6. Package results concisely so they can be easily communicated with everyone
  
  We're on the first step right now. We need some interesting questions.

## "Problems" (traps) to avoid
Anything can be interesting, and we know there are problems in every aspect of life. But we have to be careful to not be totally open to any problem. Some "problems" are traps. This is common in politics. A good example is trans/gender issues in the press. Both sides of the political spectrum love to have heated debates about these issues. They are not so common, and any reasonable level-headed person knows to handle these sorts of things on a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, each side debates & fights endlessly over broad-brush solutions that will never work. "Problems" in this area are useless to solve. Perhaps it would be useful to do a future blog post elaborating on and detailing this class of problems.

The point here is that we don't want to be fooled. Some people spend their entire lives thinking about and debating these sorts of problems. There is no broad-brush solution to be had, and these people waste their time. The last thing I want to do is waste my time.

I think it would be useful to make a to-do list with blog topics to write about in the future. Some things to add to this list are:
- class of pseudo or trap problems
- identifying a hierarchy of problems. What problems are worth solving? The two cases I can imagine are:
    - It's a spectrum. Some problems are *really* worth solving. Some are worth solving but not as important as the top problems. Others are pointless and should be ignored
    - It's a binary. Problems are either worth solving or should be ignored
- I should probably also add a post on the philosophy of this site. I'm sure I can find out much about this on the internet. Should this be a research blog? Or should this be a blog where I build a framework for the world entirely from first-principles reasoning? Or should it be a mixture of the two
- The previous bullet point seems like a meta-topic. I need a post to explore whether there are other meta-issues to address before I start going on the blog. 
- This isn't a blog post, but I think it would be interesting to build a framework for a blog site that is living & breathing. Posts can be updated at any point. There is a drop-down list in the top right corner of the page, where users can select the version of the post that is being displayed. It would be automatically set to the most recent version of the post. I want this for my site, to increase transparency.

## Finally, some interesting problems
I will have to later classify these problems according to the problem framework I build. For now, I will try to find some problems in interesting areas.
### Politics
- What to do about abortion
- What to do about the clash of cultures
### The "Optimal Life"
- What is the best way to live my life?
- Best balance of healthy eating, exercise, and social experiences to have.
- The best way to spend my time?
- The best way to not feel like I'm wasting my time?
- Is it worthwhile to spend any time at all trying to make money?
### Future of Humanity
- how to deal with the rapidly increasing technology problem? Will technology keep advancing at an exponential rate? Or are we dealing with an s-curve?
- Population/food problems?
- Are aliens real? (doubtful)
- Is it possible to live forever?
### Technology/Science/Math
- obviously, all of the Millenium problems would be interesting to solve. Might be a waste of time since I'm not quite genius-level intelligence
- any sort of engineering problem

I should add a running document with problems on it so that I can add new/interesting problems as they arise. These problems are good for now. Next up is identifying the hierarchy of problems.

Quick note - I should also add a document that serves as a map for the site. Updates as I add blog posts and explore new topics.
