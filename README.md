# Hi, I'm Prine Macdonald  
I'm interested in many things, but my two favorites are learning and reasoning. The world-wide web provides an exciting opportunity to contribute to the world! I am fairly smart (poor reflexes, not the best social skills, but intelligence is my is my only gift). I want to use my reasoning abilities to contribute to civilization. This blog aims to be concise and thorough in exploring any topic I deem to be interesting or important.
