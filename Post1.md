The pillars of this blog are listed below.  below serve as the constitution for this blog. In the compliance section, I detail how each condition will be met. 

---
## Rules
1. Blog posts must be an honest attempt at exploring a topic in an unbiased, thoughtful, and thorough way. 
2. No money will ever be made from this blog
3. This blog is only for the thoughts, ideas and analyses of me, Prine Macdonald
4. Blog posts should contain as few words as possible
5. Topics covered in this blog are anything I find interesting
6. Readers should be able to easily view any changes/edits made, as well as any previous versions of the blog

## Compliance
### Rule 1
This rule is to ensure quality of content. Readers should expect published content to be interesting. Unfortunately, there is no surefire way to ensure that this rule is followed. It is up to my integrity, and I must gain the trust of readers by producing consistently reliable content.
### Rule 2
This is to ensure the integrity of the content. How can readers trust this blog to be free of outside influences? Removing outside influences seems like an easy way to do this. 
### Rule 3
Once again to ensure the integrity. Only Prine Macdonald will have a say on this blog. Might make things less interesting, but you can trust that these ideas are strictly my own. Not even editing by other people will be allowed.
### Rule 4
For readability. Like most people, I tend towards infinite digressions.
### Rule 5
For my sake, so I don't get pigeonholed.
### Rule 6
To ensure integrity and transparency. Currently, this is accomplished through Github, as this is a Github pages site. All former versions can be found in the public Github repo. I would like to make a dynamic website in the future, so I will need a better solution for this.
